Developed a comprehensive Haskell-based simulation of Texas Hold'em Poker, demonstrating advanced functional programming, game theory, and algorithmic skills. Key highlights include:

Game Mechanics:

Simulated all phases of a no-limit Texas Hold'em game: Pre-Flop, Flop, Turn, and River.
Supported human and AI-driven players with configurable behaviors: Random, Passive, Aggressive, and Smart.
Implemented realistic betting rounds, including blinds, raises, and pot distribution.
Player and Strategy Design:

Designed data types for players, cards, and game states, ensuring modular and extensible architecture.
Created decision-making algorithms for AI players, incorporating strategies based on betting history, hand evaluation, and community cards.
Technical Implementation:

Used Haskell's type system for modeling game entities and ensuring correctness.
Integrated IO operations to handle player actions, game progression, and real-time updates.
Implemented efficient algorithms for deck shuffling, hand evaluation, and winner determination.
Testing and Simulations:

Ran large-scale simulations (1,000+ games) to evaluate AI strategies and overall game logic.
Analyzed results to refine AI behaviors and improve strategy performance.
Interactive Features:

Console-based interface for human player participation, enabling name customization and decision-making in real-time.
Configurable game setup to specify the number and type of AI players.
This project showcases expertise in functional programming, algorithm design, and software engineering for game simulations.
