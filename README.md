Developed a Haskell-based simulation of Texas Hold'em Poker, showcasing proficiency in functional programming, game logic design, and algorithmic strategies. Key highlights include:
Game Mechanics:
Simulated all stages of a poker game, including Pre-Flop, Flop, Turn, and River, with dynamic betting and player interactions.
Implemented realistic game rules, including blinds, hand evaluations, and pot sharing among winners.
Designed behavior models for various player strategies: Random, Passive, Aggressive, Smart, and Human.
Technical Implementation:
Data Modeling: Represented cards, players, and game states using Haskell data types and algebraic structures.
Functional Programming:
Created pure and impure functions for modular gameplay logic, ensuring maintainability.
Used list comprehensions and higher-order functions for operations like shuffling and evaluating hands.
Hand Evaluation:
Built a ranking system for poker hands (e.g., Straight, Flush, Full House).
Incorporated decision-making algorithms to handle complex game scenarios.
Scalability and Extensibility:
Configured dynamic player creation with customizable strategies and adjustable game parameters.
Supported simulations with up to 10 players, with logic to handle edge cases such as ties and bankruptcies.
Interactive Features:
Provided console-based visual feedback with intuitive separators and formatted outputs for game events.
Allowed human player participation alongside AI-driven players.
This project demonstrates a strong grasp of Haskell, algorithm design, and practical applications of functional programming in game development.
